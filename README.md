# Electric Bill Due Date Calculator

Simple python script to calculate electric bill due dates for certain energy providers in New Zealand.

Certain energy providers in New Zealand do not issue invoices and due dates consistently on the same dates every month.

They will instead aim to issue an invoice date and due date on a certain date each month, but the date could change depending on working days or holidays.

To use the script, simply change the 'year' and 'month' variable, and then run to get the invoice and due date for your selection.
